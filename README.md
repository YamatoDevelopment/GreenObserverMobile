Mobile application for GreenObserver

## Inspiration  
Environmental issues like littering, pollution, and poor waste management often go unnoticed or unaddressed due to a lack of centralized reporting. Many communities struggle to get municipal authorities to take action. We wanted to build a tool that empowers residents to report environmental problems in their neighborhoods and collectively advocate for solutions through community engagement.  

## What it does  
Green Observer allows users to take photos and report environmental issues, categorizing them under **Litter & Waste, Pollution, Water Drainage, Wildlife & Nature, Public Hazards,** or **Other**. Reports are displayed on an interactive map where community members can upvote issues they find important and leave comments to provide more context. The goal is to create a transparent system where municipalities can prioritize and address concerns based on real community feedback.  

## How we built it  
- **Frontend**: Built with **Flutter**, ensuring a smooth cross-platform mobile experience.  
- **Backend**: Developed in **Python**, handling user submissions, comments, and upvotes.  

## Challenges we ran into  
- Designing a reporting system that balances ease of use with sufficient detail for municipalities.  
- Implementing real-time updates to reflect community engagement (upvotes/comments) without performance bottlenecks.  
- Ensuring the platform remains free from spam and misuse while maintaining accessibility.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of  
- Successfully creating a **seamless user experience** for reporting environmental issues.  
- Building a **scalable architecture** that can support a growing number of reports.  
- Developing an **interactive map** that visually highlights problem areas.  
- Encouraging **community participation** through upvotes and discussions.  

## What we learned  
- The importance of **user-friendly UI/UX** in driving engagement for civic apps.  
- How to integrate **real-time community feedback** into a reporting system.  
- Best practices in **scaling infrastructure** for future cloud deployment.  

## What's next for Green Observer  
- **Cloud Deployment**: Hosting the backend on **AWS** and managing infrastructure with **Terraform** for scalability.  
- **Government Integration**: Partnering with local authorities to ensure reports lead to real-world action.  
- **AI-Powered Issue Detection**: Using image recognition to automatically categorize reports.  
- **Expanded Reporting Features**: Adding video submissions and severity ratings.  
- **Gamification & Rewards**: Encouraging participation through badges and recognition for active users.
